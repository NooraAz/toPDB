## Converting different file types to PDB (only mol2 is supported so far)

There are many file converters out there, but none of them are able to assign amino acid names for a PDB format, and the residues are all names UNK or RES. 
Including:
- https://datascience.unm.edu/tomcat/biocomp/convert
- open babel


In this repo, you can easily convert mol2 to PDB, by assigning the residue names correctly.
*Note: Right now, it only works for L- and D-amino acids.*
